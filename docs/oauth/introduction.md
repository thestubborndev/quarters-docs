# Quarters OAuth

![oauth screenshot](../img/oauth.png)

The Quarters API allows developers to use the OAuth2 protocol to allow a Quarters user to grant a 3rd party application full or partial access to his/her account, without sharing the account's API key or login credentials. It is a slightly more complex integration than the API Key authentication method, but is more flexible. OAuth2 works well for web applications, as well as desktop and mobile apps.
