# Getting started

Our API makes it easy to integrate Quarters into both new and existing game
applications.

Quarter's APIs enable a variety of capabilities; from simply gathering read-only
data, to building something that's never been done before

Capabilities:

* Create user account with Ethereum wallet and buy quarters
* Retrieve user account information, send transfer requests using oauth
* Retrieve historical price, tranche and supply information
* Accept and request quarters as a game developer

We offer a variety of client libraries and server SDKs.

### Start with your first app

There are two ways you can integrate Quarters in your game - Quarters buttons and using SDK. But to start with it, you will need to create app on Quarters platform. One can create multiple apps.
